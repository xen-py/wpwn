# www.wpwnews.site
This is the website I made for the newspaper club at my school. It comes complete with a database(soon), and an Admin site with encrypted user passwords. You can head to the admin site by double click "Wagner Press" or holding it in mobile. Admin can easily change all the article formats images and texts without knowing a lick of code from the user friendly site.  

3rd Party Softwares used:
VS code (ide)
Dreamhost (webhosting, domain renting)
FileZilla (sftp file transfers)
Apache (Local Server testing)
Hostinger (New domain renting)
Firebase (New Webhost, and Database)
StackOverflow (Of course)
